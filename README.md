I SPENT LIKE 5 HOURS WASTING MY LIFE TRYING TO DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOLLOWING THIS GITHUB GUIDE ON IMPORTING A THEME. THE PAGE WAS TALKING ABOUT SO MUCH SETUP AND DOWNLOADING
AND THE ENTIRE GUIDE WAS FOR MACOS SO I HAD TO DOWNLOAD EVEN MORE STUFF. AFTER I DOWNLOADED IT THE ONLY GUIDES FOR ANY JEKYLL SETUP WERE FOR MACS ANYWAYS SO I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO DO ANYTHING. WHEN I ASKED MY COMP MAJOR BROTHER HE JUST TOLD ME TO USE A MAC. AND WHEN I FOUND OUT WHAT TO DO YOU JUST HAD TO CLICK LIKE 2 BUTTONS AND NOT DO **ANYTHING**. I WAS SO MAD I WAS CONSIDERING JUST TO UNINSTALL WINDOWS AND USE THE STUPID OS THAT THE CHROMEBOOKS USE OR SOMETHING BECAUSE I WAS TOO DUMB TO USE WINDOWS.
